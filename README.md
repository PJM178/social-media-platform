# Social Media Platform
The aim of this web app is to mimic something like Twitter. Users can register an account and post "blogs" on the site. Users can and follow like the blogs and post comments on them. The complete featureset is not set in stone as the aim of the project is to learn more about TypeScript and GraphQL as well as PostgreSQL implementation. Using GraphQL subscriptions could be interesting in implementing live chat between users or maybe even chat rooms.

Currently working on:

  *Implemented Apollo Server and postreSQL and simple query.

Made with TypeScript and React in the frontend and TypeScript and GraphQL in the backend. PostgreSQL is used as a database.
